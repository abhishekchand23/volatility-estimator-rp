  abstract = {Improved estimators of security price volatilities are formulated. These estimators employ data of the type commonly found in the financial pages of a newspaper: the high, low, opening, and closing prices and the transaction volume. The new estimators are seen to have relative efficiencies that are considerably higher than the standard estimators.},
