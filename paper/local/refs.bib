  abstract = {Improved estimators of security price volatilities are formulated. These estimators employ data of the type commonly found in the financial pages of a newspaper: the high, low, opening, and closing prices and the transaction volume. The new estimators are seen to have relative efficiencies that are considerably higher than the standard estimators.},

  abstract = {The Garman-Klass unbiased estimator of the variance per unit time of a zero-drift Brownian Motion B, based on the usual financial data that reports for time windows of equal length the open (OPEN), minimum (MIN), maximum (MAX) and close (CLOSE) values, is quadratic in the statistic S1=(CLOSE-OPEN, OPEN-MIN, MAX-OPEN). This estimator, with efficiency 7.4 with respect to the classical estimator (CLOSE-OPEN){\textasciicircum}2, is widely believed to be of minimal variance. The current report disproves this belief by exhibiting an unbiased estimator with slightly but strictly higher efficiency 7.7322. The essence of the improvement lies in the observation that the data should be compressed to the statistic S2 defined on W(t)= B(0)+[B(t)-B(0)]sign[(B(1)-B(0)] as S1 was defined on the Brownian path B(t). The best S2-based quadratic unbiased estimator is presented explicitly. The Cramer-Rao upper bound for the efficiency of unbiased estimators, corresponding to the efficiency of large-sample Maximum Likelihood estimators, is 8.471. This bound cannot be attained because the distribution is not of exponential type. Regression-fitted quadratic functions of S2 (with mean 1) markedly out-perform those of S1 when applied to random walks with heavy-tail-distributed increments. Performance is empirically studied in terms of the tail parameter.},

  abstract = {If S is the price of a common stock, it is now generally accepted that ln (S) follows a random walk, at least to a very good approximation. The diffusion constant characterizing that walk, which is the same as the variance of the rate of return, thus becomes an important quantity to calculate and is traditionally estimated using closing prices only. It is shown that the use of extreme values (the high and low prices) provides a far superior estimate.}

  abstract = {The log of the price of a share is commonly modelled as a Brownian motion with drift, ? Bt + ct, where the constants c and ? are unknown. In order to use the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, one needs an estimate of ?, though not of c. In this paper, we propose a new estimator of ? based on the high, low, and closing prices in a day's trading. This estimator has the merit of being unbiased whatever the drift c. In common with other estimators of ?, the approximation of the true high and low values of the drifting Brownian motion by the high and low values of a random walk introduces error, often quite a serious error. We shall show how a simple correction can overcome this error almost completely.},

  abstract = {We present a new volatility estimator based on multiple periods of high, low, open, and close prices in a historical time series. The new estimator has the following nice properties: it is (a) unbiased in the continuous limit, (b) independent of the drift, (c) consistent in dealing with opening price jumps. Furthermore, it has the smallest variance among all estimators with similar properties. The improvement of accuracy over the classical close?to?close estimator is dramatic for real?life time series.},
