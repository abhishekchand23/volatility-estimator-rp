\begin{abstract}
This paper develops a constructive algorithm to generate a family of unbiased extreme-value volatility estimators when log prices follow Brownian motion with drift and jumps. The approach unifies existing estimators---Parkinson, Garman--Klass, Rogers--Satchell, and Yang--Zhang---as special cases and yields new minimum-variance estimators. Simulations confirm efficiency gains and demonstrate applicability when only OHLC data are available.

\section{Introduction}
Volatility estimation is fundamental in asset pricing, risk management, and option valuation. Existing estimators based on daily close-to-close returns discard valuable intraday information. Starting with \citet{parkinson1980ExtremeValueMethod} and \citet{garman1980EstimationSecurityPrice}, researchers have developed estimators using high, low, open, and close (OHLC) prices that improve efficiency substantially. Later contributions include \citet{rogers1991EstimatingVarianceHigh} and \citet{yang2000DriftIndependentVolatilityEstimation}, who address bias under drift and overnight jumps, and \citet{meilijson2009GarmanKlassVolatilityEstimator}, who further improve efficiency by compressing range data.

This paper introduces a unified, constructive framework that systematically derives the family of unbiased estimators under a given price process and information set. Known estimators emerge as special cases, and the method yields new minimum-variance estimators, including an improved high--low estimator that dominates the Parkinson estimator in efficiency.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper develops a null-space-based constructive method for volatility estimation, recovers existing estimators, and derives new minimum-variance estimators. The approach is constructive, adaptable to more complex price processes, and suitable for multi-asset extensions. Future research may apply this method to stochastic volatility models and empirical financial data.
